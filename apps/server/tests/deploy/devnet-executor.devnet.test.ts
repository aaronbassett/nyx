/**
 * Devnet round-trip test for the real deploy executor (P4 Task 2, Step 6) — `DEVNET_URL`-gated.
 *
 * This is the Independent Test for the deploy executor's SDK boundary. It skips cleanly without
 * `DEVNET_URL` (the same gate idiom as `ledger/indexer-observation.devnet.test.ts` and
 * `pg-registry.test.ts`), so CI — which has no devnet — never runs it.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS LIVE (verified, wallet-free): the real `sdk-adapter.ts` `queryFinality` transport
 * — the recipe-verified indexer `transactions(offset:{ identifier })` GraphQL poll [recipe element
 * 4] — runs against the live devnet indexer (`4.2.1`, `/api/v4/graphql`) without a transport error,
 * and a not-yet-seen tx id resolves to `{ status: "pending" }` (the finality signal's "absent ⇒
 * not finalized" leg). This proves the finality poll loop `awaitFinality` drives is wired to a real
 * indexer.
 *
 * ⚠️ OWNER-GATED (the full green deploy). `prove → signAndSubmit → awaitFinality:{finalized,address}`
 * needs the SDK build + wallet-facade submit seams (`buildUnprovenDeploy` / `submitProvenDeploy` in
 * `sdk-adapter.ts`) wired against a FUNDED, DUST-registered deploy wallet — P5 has not run, so the
 * owner runs this leg with a genesis seed per SPIKE-2 §Funding (seeds `0x…01`–`0x…03` are the only
 * genesis-funded ones on this devnet; `…01`=SPIKE-1, `…03`=SPIKE-2, `…02`=P4 Task 1's live runs, so
 * a NEW consumer funds a child wallet from a genesis seed). Left as an explicit `todo` that unblocks
 * the moment those two seams + the funded wallet land — mirroring the `indexer-observation` devnet
 * test's owner-gated green-path todo. This deploy spends devnet-only tDUST.
